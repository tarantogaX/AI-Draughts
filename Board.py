# The Board class keeps the state of the game at a given time. It's most important fields are: whites (a list of all the white pawns on the board), blacks (a list of all the black pawns on the board), world (a two-dimentional list, representing the board. Each field is either null (if there is no piece standing there) or it points to a piece which stands at a given place).
# Therefore, we have a double information about each piece

# White is the player, who moves next (this makes implementation easier: we don't have to 'if' everywhere whose move it is)
# Rows are represented by 'y' axis, columns by 'x' axis. Both are indexed from 0 to 9. (0, 0) is the left-upper square
